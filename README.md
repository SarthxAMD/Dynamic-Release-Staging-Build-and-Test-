source code for Dynamic Release Staging (Build and Test) 

Problem Statement
Aim to optimize our build and testing pipeline by creating a comprehensive dependency matrix that accurately maps out the affected by cherry pick in different components. Based on that, need streamline our build and dynamic test pipelines that includes only affected components test.
Our ultimate goal is to reduce the overall staging time by adding the above implementation.

Scope:
This initiative will involve developing the dependency matrix, modifying the build and test processes to incorporate only required libraries, and measuring the impact on pipeline performance. Success will be evaluated based on the reduction in pipeline time and the accuracy of the dependency matrix.

Approach:
Data Extraction and Input Handling:
Source Identification: Start by gathering cherry pick/ PR information from our release confluence page. This may include hyperlinks of multiple cherry picks, descriptive texts, or any relevant identifiers that highlight the libraries we need to manage.
Smart Parsing: Develop a parsing tool to intelligently extract and categorize this input data
Collect hyperlinks of cherry picks 
Cherry pick branch and PR status (open or merged).

Build Creation:
Meanwhile, in build creation, start by reading the data in the given hyperlinks of cherry pick to check the PR status (active or merged). Accordingly, must enable the cherry pick in the build and add the active cherry pick. After this, start the build.
Dependency Matrix Creation: 
Construct a visually intuitive and comprehensive dependency matrix that maps out the relationships between the identified libraries. This matrix will serve as our blueprint for understanding how each library interacts with others.

Dependency Validation and Recursive Analysis:
For each library identified, use our matrix to validate and confirm its dependencies. If a library is found to have dependencies:
Recursive Discovery: Employ a recursive algorithm to explore and document all direct and indirect dependencies. This ensures that no dependency is overlooked.
Build Strategy: Develop a smart build order that respects dependency chains, ensuring that libraries are built in the optimal sequence.


Optimized Build and Testing Workflow:
	Efficient Building: Execute the build process by adhering to the determined order, starting with foundational libraries and progressing to those that depend on them.
	Rigorous Testing: Implement a structured testing phase where each library is tested individually. Ensure that all dependencies are properly integrated and functioning as expected before moving to the next library.

Outcome Expectations:
Enhanced Efficiency: Reduced build times and streamlined processes will lead to faster iteration cycles.
Improved Accuracy: Comprehensive dependency management will minimize integration issues and enhance software quality.
Accelerated Releases: With optimized builds and thorough testing, we can expedite releases and maintain high standards of software performance.

Future Vision: Our aim is to set a new standard in library management that not only meets current needs but also adapts to future requirements, ensuring sustained efficiency and excellence in our development practices and automate the whole pipeline.
